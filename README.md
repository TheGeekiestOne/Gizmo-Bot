## What is SSCAIT?
Student StarCraft AI Tournament is an educational event, first held in 2011. It serves as a challenging competitive environment mainly for students (submissions by non-students are allowed too) of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. They are submitting the bots programmed in C++ or Java using BWAPI to play 1v1 StarCraft matches.

## Supporting their on Patreon
SSCAIT is a non-profit project, but we're trying to help out young students interested in Game AI research. By supporting us on Patreon, you're directly sponsoring two things:
- The tournament itself (hardware, maintenance, hosting)
- Education of a few students and researchers in the group behind the event, called G&S Research Group. Your support allows a few enthusiastic students do Game AI research.

## Here's the current list of their official supporters:
